## 🚀 Overview

The **Interactive Multimodal AI Buddy** is an advanced AI companion designed to engage users in real-time, emotionally intelligent conversations. By integrating multimodal inputs—voice, facial expressions, and live camera vision—the system adapts its responses based on the user's emotional state and visual context, fostering natural and empathetic interactions.

This is a **desktop application** built with modern web technologies (Electron + React) for the UI and Python for AI processing, featuring a **dual-socket architecture** that separates real-time audio streaming from cognitive reasoning.
